## task discription

The objective of this task is to create a model that approximates a mapping function from an input sequence of integers ("source") to an output sequence of integers ("target") using a training data set (`train_source.txt`, `train_target.txt`), and achieve best generalization performance on a held-out test set (`test_source.txt`, `test_target.txt`). Use any technique and framework you think is appropriate. 

Please submit a link to a GitHub repository, containing your code, and `README` which describes the following:

1. your experiment design (including baselines and models and/or data exploration results)
2. evaluation metrics
3. experimental results.
